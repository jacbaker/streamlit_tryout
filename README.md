# Streamlit

I followed the info on https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line up to step 7., which worked fine,

except need to use `python3` not just `python` on my system.

I used the terminal within VSCode.

Type CTRL-C to stop the app, and go on ot step 10.

Steps 10 to 15 worked fine.

I went on to https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals

#### Git

tried to ignore .venv directory but it went up there anyway. Deleted on Github, now check if I do new push
